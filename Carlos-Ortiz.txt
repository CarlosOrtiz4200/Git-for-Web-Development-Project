Stretch Review questions:

 1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 
    
    inline: allows you to get the width and height on each element. you can also create a grid of boxes
    Block: a line break happens after the element so a block element doesnt sit well with other elements

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
  
    The value is absolute or fixed and positionsed relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
    The top,right,bottom, and left properties offsets from the edges of the containing block.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    
    elements differ in sizes and is based on width of the parent element if the parent width changes then the child width
    changes too. We also know that it can prevent stretching by adjusting the width, you will also need 
    margins to space out and we also cant forget padding

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default 
    none
    block
    inline

    button
    input
    select
    text area

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

  builds more complex layout tasks with an understanding the width and height properties are respected
  the box extends inline direction to fill available space. the layers for a box model are:
  content box, padding box, border box, and the margin box.

   The fix is to include padding and border in a elements total width and height
